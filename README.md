# Pizza-Sales-Report

Overview
   This project demonstrates a data analysis workflow designed to derive insights from pizza sales data. The project is divided into two key parts:
   1. Database Management and Querying with MS SQL Server
   2. Data Visualization with Tableau
   The aim is to calculate and visualize various metrics and trends to better understand business performance and customer behavior.

   The goal of this analysis is to evaluate key indicators and visualize trends for our pizza sales data. The specific objectives include:
Metrics to Calculate:
   Total Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
   Average Order Value: The average spend per order.
   Total Pizzas Sold: The total quantity of pizzas sold.
   Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.
   Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order.
Visualization Requirements:
   Hourly Trend for Total Pizzas Sold: A stacked bar chart to identify order volume patterns on an hourly basis.
   Weekly Trend for Total Orders: A line chart to highlight peak weeks or periods of high order activity.
   Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category: A pie chart to reveal the distribution of sales across pizza categories
   Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size: A pie chart to understand customer preferences for pizza sizes.
   Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category: A funnel chart comparing the sales performance of different pizza categories.
   Top 5 Best Sellers: A bar chart showcasing the top-performing pizzas by revenue, quantity, and total orders.
   Bottom 5 Best Sellers: A bar chart highlighting the least popular pizzas based on revenue, quantity, and total orders.

Workflow
    Part 1: Database Management with MS SQL Server
       Imported the data from the csv file which is added in the repository with a name pizza_sales.csv and structured the sales data in 
       MS SQL Server.
       Created a database for storing and organizing the data.
       Wrote SQL queries to calculate the required metrics.
       Generated a report summarizing the insights derived from SQL queries.
    Part 2: Data Visualization with Tableau
       Connected Tableau to the MS SQL Server database.
       Processed and cleaned the data for visualization.
       Designed and developed interactive dashboards to showcase key metrics and trends.
Key Insights
    This analysis and visualization provide insights into:

Peak sales hours and weeks.
   The most and least popular pizza categories and sizes.
   Customer preferences and their impact on revenue.
